# BYOL-Bio-BERT-ON-MIMIC-Chest-X-ray-Dataset
This repository contains the code to train a combined model using ResNet-50 and BioBERT for multi-modal data. The model leverages BYOL (Bootstrap Your Own Latent) for self-supervised learning on images and integrates it with BioBERT for textual data processing.
